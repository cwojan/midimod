This document features code where I am learning the ropes of using Python to receive and interpret MIDI signals.

This cell prints names of MIDI inputs connected (from ChatGPT)
```{python}
import mido

print(mido.get_input_names())

```

This cell monitors midi signals from those inputs (from ChatGPT)

```{python}
with mido.open_input('USB Midi  USB Midi') as inport:
    for msg in inport:
        print(msg)


```

Editing the above cell to only display 'note on' messages (used copilot, gave me the code I expected)

(switched to monitoring note velocity instead)

```{python}
with mido.open_input('USB Midi  USB Midi') as inport:
    for msg in inport:
        if msg.velocity > 0:
            print(msg)
        
```

trying os module

```{python}
import os
import time

print(os.getcwd())
time.sleep(2)
os.system('clear')
```
